# Mobile Fallback Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

The "Out of memory" error on mobile browsers has been addressed with the following improvements:

### 1. **Memory-Optimized WASM Configuration**
- Mobile devices now use 128MB initial memory (vs 256MB on desktop)
- Maximum memory capped at 256MB on mobile (vs 512MB on desktop)
- Memory growth enabled for dynamic allocation

### 2. **Mobile-Optimized Audio Settings**
- Reduced audio bitrate on mobile (64kbps vs 128kbps)
- Smaller FFT size for mobile (512 vs 256)
- Higher latency for stability (0.02s vs 0.01s)
- Slower processing intervals (2s vs 1s)

### 3. **Automatic Mobile Fallback**
- When WASM fails on mobile, automatically switches to Web Speech API
- Provides the same interface as the main service
- Uses browser-native speech recognition instead of WASM

## How to Test

### Option 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open the app on your mobile device
2. Open browser developer tools (if possible)
3. Look for these log messages:
   - `"Mobile device detected - using memory-optimized configuration"`
   - `"Memory error detected on mobile device, attempting fallback..."`
   - `"Mobile fallback voice activation initialized successfully"`

### Option 2: Use Debug Functions
1. Open the app on your mobile device
2. In the browser console, run:
   ```javascript
   // Check if mobile fallback is active
   window.testMobileFallback?.()
   
   // Check overall status
   window.debugState?.()
   ```

### Option 3: Check Status
The voice activation service now returns a status object that includes:
```javascript
{
  isListening: boolean,
  isProcessing: boolean,
  isReady: boolean,
  useMobileFallback: boolean, // This will be true if fallback is active
  isSupported: boolean // For mobile fallback
}
```

## Expected Behavior

### If WASM Works:
- You'll see: `"Whisper model initialized successfully with Transformers.js"`
- Voice activation will work with full Whisper functionality

### If WASM Fails (Memory Error):
- You'll see: `"Memory error detected on mobile device, attempting fallback..."`
- Then: `"Mobile fallback voice activation initialized successfully"`
- Voice activation will work using Web Speech API
- The `useMobileFallback` status will be `true`

### If Both Fail:
- You'll see the helpful error message: `"Voice activation requires more memory than available on this device. Please try closing other apps or using a device with more memory."`

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing the memory error:

1. **Check if Web Speech API is supported**:
   ```javascript
   console.log('webkitSpeechRecognition' in window);
   console.log('SpeechRecognition' in window);
   ```

2. **Try closing other apps** to free up memory

3. **Check browser compatibility** - Web Speech API works on:
   - Chrome/Edge (Android/iOS)
   - Safari (iOS 14.5+)
   - Firefox (limited support)

4. **Force refresh** the page to clear any cached WASM modules

## What's Different Now

- **Better Error Messages**: Users get clear guidance instead of cryptic WASM errors
- **Automatic Fallback**: No manual intervention needed
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced memory usage on mobile devices
- **Graceful Degradation**: App continues to work even when WASM fails

The voice activation should now work on mobile devices either through the optimized WASM implementation or through the Web Speech API fallback.
