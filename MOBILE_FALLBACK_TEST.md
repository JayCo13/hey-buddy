# Mobile Voice Activation Guide

## What Was Fixed

The "Out of memory" error on mobile browsers has been addressed with a **hybrid approach**:

### 1. **Ultra-Conservative WASM Configuration** (Primary)
- Mobile devices now use 64MB initial memory (vs 256MB on desktop)
- Maximum memory capped at 128MB on mobile (vs 512MB on desktop)
- Memory growth enabled for dynamic allocation
- Disabled progress callbacks to save memory

### 2. **Ultra-Conservative Audio Settings** (Primary)
- Ultra-low audio bitrate on mobile (32kbps vs 128kbps)
- Smaller FFT size for mobile (512 vs 256)
- Higher latency for stability (0.02s vs 0.01s)
- Much slower processing intervals (3s vs 1s)

### 3. **Mobile-Optimized Whisper Processing** (Primary)
- Shorter audio chunks on mobile (10s vs 15s)
- Smaller stride length on mobile (1s vs 2s)
- Reduced token generation on mobile (32 vs 64 tokens)
- Deterministic output with no sampling overhead

### 4. **Web Speech API Fallback** (Secondary)
- Automatically switches to Web Speech API when WASM fails
- Uses the same working approach as the RecordScreen
- Provides seamless "Hey Buddy" wake word detection
- Works offline but requires internet for speech recognition

## How to Test

### Option 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open the app on your mobile device
2. Open browser developer tools (if possible)
3. Look for these log messages:

**If WASM works:**
- `"Mobile device detected - using ultra-aggressive memory optimization"`
- `"Whisper model initialized successfully with Transformers.js"`
- `"Real-time wake word detection started successfully"`

**If WASM fails and switches to Web Speech API:**
- `"Memory error detected on mobile device, attempting Web Speech API fallback..."`
- `"Web Speech API fallback voice activation initialized successfully"`

### Option 2: Use Debug Functions
1. Open the app on your mobile device
2. In the browser console, run:
   ```javascript
   // Check if Web Speech API fallback is active
   window.testWebSpeechFallback?.()
   
   // Check overall status
   window.debugState?.()
   ```

### Option 3: Check Status
The voice activation service now returns a status object that includes:
```javascript
{
  isListening: boolean,
  isProcessing: boolean,
  isReady: boolean,
  useWebSpeechFallback: boolean, // This will be true if fallback is active
  isSupported: boolean // For Web Speech API fallback
}
```

## Expected Behavior

### If WASM Works with Optimizations:
- You'll see: `"Mobile device detected - using ultra-aggressive memory optimization"`
- Then: `"Whisper model initialized successfully with Transformers.js"`
- Voice activation will work with optimized Whisper functionality
- Processing will be slower but more memory-efficient

### If WASM Fails and Switches to Web Speech API:
- You'll see: `"Memory error detected on mobile device, attempting Web Speech API fallback..."`
- Then: `"Web Speech API fallback voice activation initialized successfully"`
- Voice activation will work using Web Speech API (same as RecordScreen)
- The `useWebSpeechFallback` status will be `true`

### Both Systems Work:
- Say "Hey Buddy" and the app will navigate to the RecordScreen
- The RecordScreen will work perfectly with Web Speech API (as shown in your image)

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing the memory error:

1. **Check if Web Speech API is supported**:
   ```javascript
   console.log('webkitSpeechRecognition' in window);
   console.log('SpeechRecognition' in window);
   ```

2. **Try closing other apps** to free up memory

3. **Check browser compatibility** - Web Speech API works on:
   - Chrome/Edge (Android/iOS)
   - Safari (iOS 14.5+)
   - Firefox (limited support)

4. **Force refresh** the page to clear any cached WASM modules

## What's Different Now

- **Hybrid Approach**: WASM first, Web Speech API fallback
- **Ultra-Conservative Memory Usage**: 64MB initial, 128MB max on mobile
- **Optimized Audio Processing**: 32kbps bitrate, 3s intervals
- **Mobile-Specific Whisper Settings**: Shorter chunks, fewer tokens
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamlessly switches to Web Speech API when WASM fails
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear guidance for memory issues

The voice activation should now work on mobile devices with either ultra-aggressive WASM optimizations or automatic Web Speech API fallback, ensuring the "Hey Buddy" wake word detection always works.
