# Mobile Voice Activation Guide

## What Was Fixed

The "Out of memory" error on mobile browsers has been addressed with a **hybrid approach**:

### 1. **Ultra-Conservative WASM Configuration** (Primary)
- Mobile devices now use 64MB initial memory (vs 256MB on desktop)
- Maximum memory capped at 128MB on mobile (vs 512MB on desktop)
- Memory growth enabled for dynamic allocation
- Disabled progress callbacks to save memory

### 2. **Ultra-Conservative Audio Settings** (Primary)
- Ultra-low audio bitrate on mobile (32kbps vs 128kbps)
- Smaller FFT size for mobile (512 vs 256)
- Higher latency for stability (0.02s vs 0.01s)
- Much slower processing intervals (3s vs 1s)

### 3. **Mobile-Optimized Whisper Processing** (Primary)
- Shorter audio chunks on mobile (10s vs 15s)
- Smaller stride length on mobile (1s vs 2s)
- Reduced token generation on mobile (32 vs 64 tokens)
- Deterministic output with no sampling overhead

### 4. **Web Speech API Fallback** (Secondary)
- Automatically switches to Web Speech API when WASM fails
- Uses the same working approach as the RecordScreen
- Provides seamless "Hey Buddy" wake word detection
- Works offline but requires internet for speech recognition

## How to Test

### Option 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open the app on your mobile device
2. Open browser developer tools (if possible)
3. Look for these log messages:

**If WASM works:**
- `"Mobile device detected - using ultra-aggressive memory optimization"`
- `"Whisper model initialized successfully with Transformers.js"`
- `"Real-time wake word detection started successfully"`

**If WASM fails and switches to Web Speech API:**
- `"ðŸ”„ Switching to Web Speech API due to WASM memory error"`
- `"ðŸŽ¤ Starting Web Speech API listening..."`
- `"ðŸŽ¤ Web Speech API detected 'Hey Buddy'!"`

### Option 2: Use Manual Toggle
1. Open the app on your mobile device
2. Look for the "Switch to Web Speech API" button in the AI Voice Generator card
3. Click it to manually switch between systems
4. The button will show "Using Web Speech API" when active

### Option 3: Check Status Indicators
- **Blue indicator**: WASM/Whisper system active
- **Green indicator**: Web Speech API system active
- **Status text**: Shows which system is currently listening

## Expected Behavior

### If WASM Works with Optimizations:
- You'll see: `"Mobile device detected - using ultra-aggressive memory optimization"`
- Blue audio level indicator
- Status: "ðŸŽ¤ Listening..." or "Ready to listen"

### If WASM Fails and Switches to Web Speech API:
- You'll see: `"ðŸ”„ Switching to Web Speech API due to WASM memory error"`
- Green audio level indicator
- Status: "ðŸŽ¤ Listening (Web Speech API)..." or "Ready to listen (Web Speech API)"
- Manual toggle button appears

### Both Systems Work:
- Say "Hey Buddy" and the app will navigate to the RecordScreen
- The RecordScreen will work perfectly with Web Speech API (as shown in your image)

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing the memory error:

1. **Try closing other apps** to free up memory

2. **Check available memory** on your device

3. **Force refresh** the page to clear any cached WASM modules

4. **Try a different browser** - some browsers handle WASM memory better

5. **Restart your device** to free up system memory

## What's Different Now

- **Hybrid Approach**: WASM first, Web Speech API fallback
- **Ultra-Conservative Memory Usage**: 64MB initial, 128MB max on mobile
- **Optimized Audio Processing**: 32kbps bitrate, 3s intervals
- **Mobile-Specific Whisper Settings**: Shorter chunks, fewer tokens
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamlessly switches to Web Speech API when WASM fails
- **Manual Toggle**: Users can manually switch between systems
- **Visual Indicators**: Blue for WASM, Green for Web Speech API
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear guidance for memory issues

The voice activation should now work on mobile devices with either ultra-aggressive WASM optimizations or automatic Web Speech API fallback, ensuring the "Hey Buddy" wake word detection always works.
