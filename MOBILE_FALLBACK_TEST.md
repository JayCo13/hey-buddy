# Mobile Memory Optimization Guide

## What Was Fixed

The "Out of memory" error on mobile browsers has been addressed with ultra-aggressive memory optimizations:

### 1. **Ultra-Conservative WASM Configuration**
- Mobile devices now use 64MB initial memory (vs 256MB on desktop)
- Maximum memory capped at 128MB on mobile (vs 512MB on desktop)
- Memory growth enabled for dynamic allocation
- Disabled progress callbacks to save memory

### 2. **Ultra-Conservative Audio Settings**
- Ultra-low audio bitrate on mobile (32kbps vs 128kbps)
- Smaller FFT size for mobile (512 vs 256)
- Higher latency for stability (0.02s vs 0.01s)
- Much slower processing intervals (3s vs 1s)

### 3. **Mobile-Optimized Whisper Processing**
- Shorter audio chunks on mobile (10s vs 15s)
- Smaller stride length on mobile (1s vs 2s)
- Reduced token generation on mobile (32 vs 64 tokens)
- Deterministic output with no sampling overhead

## How to Test

### Option 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open the app on your mobile device
2. Open browser developer tools (if possible)
3. Look for these log messages:
   - `"Mobile device detected - using ultra-aggressive memory optimization"`
   - `"Whisper model initialized successfully with Transformers.js"`
   - `"Real-time wake word detection started successfully"`

### Option 2: Use Debug Functions
1. Open the app on your mobile device
2. In the browser console, run:
   ```javascript
   // Check overall status
   window.debugState?.()
   ```

### Option 3: Check Status
The voice activation service now returns a status object that includes:
```javascript
{
  isListening: boolean,
  isProcessing: boolean,
  isReady: boolean
}
```

## Expected Behavior

### If WASM Works with Optimizations:
- You'll see: `"Mobile device detected - using ultra-aggressive memory optimization"`
- Then: `"Whisper model initialized successfully with Transformers.js"`
- Voice activation will work with optimized Whisper functionality
- Processing will be slower but more memory-efficient

### If WASM Still Fails:
- You'll see the helpful error message: `"Voice activation requires more memory than available on this device. Please try closing other apps or using a device with more memory."`

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing the memory error:

1. **Try closing other apps** to free up memory

2. **Check available memory** on your device

3. **Force refresh** the page to clear any cached WASM modules

4. **Try a different browser** - some browsers handle WASM memory better

5. **Restart your device** to free up system memory

## What's Different Now

- **Ultra-Conservative Memory Usage**: 64MB initial, 128MB max on mobile
- **Optimized Audio Processing**: 32kbps bitrate, 3s intervals
- **Mobile-Specific Whisper Settings**: Shorter chunks, fewer tokens
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear guidance for memory issues
- **Offline-First**: No dependency on Web Speech API

The voice activation should now work on mobile devices with ultra-aggressive memory optimizations while maintaining offline functionality.
