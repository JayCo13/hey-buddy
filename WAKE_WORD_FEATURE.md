# Wake Word Response Feature

## Overview
This feature provides an automatic, hardcoded response when users say "Hey Buddy" (the wake word) for the first time when entering the application.

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User opens the application (lands on Main Screen)
2. User says "Hey Buddy" (wake word)
3. System detects the wake word via Voice Activation Context
4. Loading screen appears with "Loading Record Room..." message
5. User is navigated to Record Screen
6. Buddy automatically responds with a hardcoded message
7. Response is displayed with a beautiful typing animation
8. Text-to-speech reads the response aloud

### Response Message
The hardcoded response is:
```
"Good morning. You have 6 meetings today. Two conflicts detected: your 2 PM with the Shanghai team overlaps with the board prep call. I've moved Shanghai to Thursday 9 AM their timeâ€”they've already confirmed. Your 10 AM needs the Q3 forecast. It's not in the shared folder. Should I follow up with finance, or would you like to handle it? The weather's clear for your 6 PM flight. Your driver's confirmed for 4:15 PM. That gives you a 30 minutes buffer. One priority: Jennifer from Accenture called twice yesterday. Marked urgent. I can dial her now, or add her to your 11 AM gap."
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`hey-buddy/frontend/src/components/TypingText.jsx`** (NEW)
   - Custom React component for typing animation effect
   - Animates text character by character
   - Shows a blinking cursor during typing
   - Configurable speed (default: 30ms per character)
   - Supports completion callback

2. **`hey-buddy/frontend/src/components/RecordScreen.jsx`**
   - Added `autoPlayWakeWordResponse` prop
   - Added state management for wake word response
   - Integrated TypingText component
   - Beautiful gradient card design with:
     - Animated background glow
     - Buddy avatar with pulsing effect
     - Status indicator (online/listening)
     - Dismiss and Replay buttons
   - Auto-plays TTS when response is displayed

3. **`hey-buddy/frontend/src/components/AppNavigator.jsx`**
   - Added `wakeWordTriggered` state
   - Tracks whether navigation was triggered by wake word vs manual navigation
   - Passes `autoPlayWakeWordResponse` prop to RecordScreen when wake word detected

### Key Features

#### Typing Animation
- Character-by-character reveal
- Configurable speed (20ms per character for this feature)
- Blinking cursor indicator
- Smooth fade-in effect

#### Visual Design
- Gradient background (blue to purple)
- Animated pulsing glow effect
- Professional card layout
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations and transitions

#### User Controls
- **Dismiss Button**: Hides the response card and resets state
- **Replay Button**: Replays the TTS audio without re-typing
- Automatic TTS speech synthesis

#### State Management
- `showWakeWordResponse`: Controls visibility of response card
- `wakeWordResponseComplete`: Tracks if typing animation finished
- `hasPlayedWakeWordResponse`: Prevents duplicate playback
- `wakeWordTriggered`: Tracks if navigation was via wake word

## Customization

### Changing the Response Message
Edit the `WAKE_WORD_RESPONSE` constant in `RecordScreen.jsx`:

```javascript
const WAKE_WORD_RESPONSE = "Your custom message here...";
```

### Adjusting Typing Speed
Modify the `speed` prop in the TypingText component:

```jsx
<TypingText 
  text={WAKE_WORD_RESPONSE}
  speed={20}  // Lower = faster, Higher = slower (in milliseconds)
  ...
/>
```

### Styling
The response card uses Tailwind CSS classes. Key styling classes:
- Background: `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-900/50 to-purple-900/50`
- Border: `border-blue-400/40`
- Animation: `animate-slideUp`, `animate-pulse`

## Wake Word Detection

The wake word detection is handled by the `VoiceActivationContext` which supports:
- "Hey Buddy" and variations
- "Hi there" and variations  
- "What's up" and variations

When detected, it triggers navigation to the Record Screen with the auto-response feature.
