## Browser-Specific Tests

### Chrome/Edge
- Should work perfectly
- Full TTS support
- Full speech recognition support

### Safari (Desktop)
- Should work with minor differences in voice
- May require user interaction for TTS

### Safari (iOS)
- Requires user tap before TTS works
- Speech recognition works after microphone permission
- May show mobile-optimized interface

### Firefox
- TTS should work
- Speech recognition may have limitations

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Wake word not detected
**Solution**: 
- Check microphone permissions
- Speak clearly and loud enough
- Try variations: "Hey Buddy", "Buddy", "Hi there"

### Issue: No typing animation
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure TypingText component is imported correctly
- Verify `showWakeWordResponse` state is true

### Issue: No TTS audio
**Solution**:
- Check browser audio permissions
- Ensure speakers/headphones are working
- On mobile, tap the screen first to enable audio
- Try the Replay button

### Issue: Response shows on manual navigation
**Solution**:
- This is a bug - `wakeWordTriggered` should be false
- Check AppNavigator logic
- Verify `autoPlayWakeWordResponse` prop

### Issue: Animation too fast/slow
**Solution**:
- Adjust `speed` prop in TypingText component
- Current: 20ms per character
- Increase for slower, decrease for faster

## Performance Verification

### Memory
- Check browser DevTools > Performance
- No memory leaks after dismiss
- Refs should be properly cleaned up

### Render Performance
- Typing animation should be smooth (60fps)
- No jank or stuttering
- Background animations don't block text typing

### Audio Performance
- TTS should start within 500ms
- No audio stuttering or glitches
- Clean audio cutoff when dismissed

## Expected Console Logs

When wake word is detected, you should see:
```
ðŸŽ¤ Wake word detected: [variation] [transcript]
ðŸŽ¤ Navigating to record room...
```

When response plays:
```
(No specific logs, but watch for errors)
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… Wake word detection works consistently  
âœ… Navigation to Record Screen is smooth  
âœ… Typing animation plays without errors  
âœ… TTS speaks the full message  
âœ… UI is visually appealing and polished  
âœ… Dismiss button clears the response  
âœ… Replay button works correctly  
âœ… No console errors  
âœ… No memory leaks  
âœ… Works on target browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge)

## Known Limitations

1. **Mobile TTS**: Requires user interaction first (browser security)
2. **Wake Word Accuracy**: Depends on microphone quality and background noise
3. **One-Time Play**: Response only plays on first wake word detection per session
4. **Browser Support**: Some older browsers may not support all features

## Demo Video Checklist

If recording a demo, show:
1. Starting the app (home screen)
2. Saying "Hey Buddy"
3. Loading screen transition
4. Typing animation in action
5. Full response text
6. TTS speaking (with audio)
7. Replay button functionality
8. Dismiss button functionality
9. Manual navigation (no auto-response)

## Feedback Points

After testing, note:
- Animation speed preference
- UI/design improvements
- TTS voice quality
- Any bugs or edge cases
- Performance on different devices
- Accessibility concerns
